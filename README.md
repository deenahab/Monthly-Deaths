# Monthly Counts of Death By Select Causes 
#### This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 course in the Spring of 2024, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

## About
-This dataset provides a numerical record of deaths that occurred for every month from 2014 to 2019. This data set includes a record for "All Cause", "Natural Cause", and other cause columns. This data repository compares the number of deaths for "All Cause", "Natural Cause", "Diseases of Heart",and "Accidents (Unintentional Injuries) for the years 2014 and 2019. "Diseases of Heart" and "Accidents (Unintentional Injuries) have the largest number of deaths for natural and unnatural causes of death. 

-This notebook is intented for users who have a very basic level of knowledge on how to use python and coding.

## Possible Usage
-This data repository can be used to understand mortality rates and anazlying the types of causes of death overtime. This repository analyzes data over a five year period, which can be used to analyze the number of deaths over time spans.

-Possibly could allow for research on specific causes of death, and allocate for preventative measures. 
## Contents
This data repository contains:

-The dataset was found from [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Monthly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-Select-Causes-2014-201/bxq8-mugm/data_preview). Here is a direct link to the csv. file: [monthly_deaths](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bxq8-mugm/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD). Also located in the "Data" folder.

-A python notebook outlining step by step instructions on how to filter and merge the data into an another subset. Known as an ipynb file. 

-The merged and filtered new subset data .csv file. Located in the "Data" folder. 

-Also includes an image for this subset in the "Data Visualization" folder. 
## Data Visualization
For this data visualization, the subset used was created using the instructions from the python notebook. This data visualization was created using the website, [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de). 

-This data visualization shows a direct comparison of the number of "All Cause" and "Natural Cause" deaths. 

-Majority of deaths are from natural causes, the largest number for unnatural deaths, "Accidents (Unintentional Incidents)" is significantly less than the cause column with the largest number for natural deaths, "Diseases of Heart".
