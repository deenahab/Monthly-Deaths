# Monthly Counts of Death By Select Causes 
## About
This monthly death count dataset provides a record of the number of deaths that occurred for every month from 2014 to 2019. This data set includes a numerical record for various causes of death and a total for the "All Cause" and  "Natural Cause" columns. This repository compares these columns for all months in the years 2014 and 2019. This data repository also compares the column with the greatest number of deaths by a natural cause, "Diseases of Heart" with the column with the greatest number of deaths by an unnatural cause, "Accidents (Unintentional Injuries)."
## Possible Usage
This data repository can be used to understand mortality rates and anazlying the types of causes of death overtime. This repository analyzes data over a five year period, which can be used to analyze the number of deaths over time spans. 
## Contents
This data repository contains:

-The original raw dataset .csv file which contains all the numerical data on monthly deaths. Located in the "Data" folder.

-A python notebook outlining step by step instructions on how to filter and merge the data into an another subset. Known as an ipynb file. 

-The merged and filtered new subset data .csv file. Located in the "Data" folder. Also includes an image for this subset in the data visualization folder. 
## Data Visualization
For this data visualization, the subset used was created using the instructions from the python notebook. This data visualization was created by using the website, Datawrapper.

This data visualization shows a direct comparison of the number of "All Cause" and "Natural Cause" deaths. This graph shows how the majority of deaths are from natural causes, rather than unnatural causes. This graph also shows how the cause column with the largest number for unnatural deaths, "Accidents (Unintentional Incidents)" is significantly less than the cause column with the largest number for natural deaths, "Diseases of Heart".
